# Intelligent Document Analysis Methodology

## Overview

This system implements an intelligent document analysis approach that combines semantic understanding with configurable domain-specific logic to extract and prioritize relevant content from document collections. The methodology addresses the challenge of finding contextually appropriate information based on specific personas and jobs-to-be-done.

## Core Approach

### Semantic Understanding with Lightweight AI

The system employs SentenceTransformers using the `all-MiniLM-L12-v2` model (118MB), which provides semantic understanding while meeting size constraints. This model converts both documents and queries into 384-dimensional vector representations, enabling similarity matching that goes beyond simple keyword matching. The model is cached to avoid redundant loading, ensuring efficient processing within the 60-second time limit.

### Multi-Stage Intelligent Filtering

The methodology implements a three-stage filtering process:

1. **Pre-filtering**: Removes irrelevant content using configurable exclusion rules (e.g., meat dishes for vegetarian requirements)
2. **Semantic Scoring**: Calculates cosine similarity between query and document embeddings
3. **Intelligent Boosting**: Applies domain-specific scoring using configurable keywords, document preferences, and penalty systems

### Configurable Domain Adaptation

All domain-specific logic is externalized into `query_config.py`, making the system truly generic. This includes:
- Query keywords organized by categories (food, presentation, dietary restrictions)
- Boost words that increase relevance scores for important concepts
- Penalty words that reduce scores for irrelevant content
- Document preferences that weight sources based on relevance
- Scoring weights that balance different relevance factors

### Performance Optimization

The system optimizes for CPU-only execution and sub-60-second processing through:
- Model caching to prevent redundant loading
- Batch processing of embeddings for efficiency
- Intelligent pre-filtering to reduce computational load
- Optimized text cleaning and JSON serialization

## Technical Implementation

The methodology processes documents by:
1. Extracting structured content using PDF parsing
2. Building intelligent queries from persona and job requirements
3. Applying semantic similarity scoring with AI embeddings
4. Combining semantic scores with domain-specific intelligence
5. Ranking and selecting top 5 most relevant sections

This approach ensures that the system can adapt to any domain while maintaining high relevance and performance standards.
