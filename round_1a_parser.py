def extract_outline_and_text(pdf_path):
    """
    Extracts structured outline (Title, H1, H2, H3 with page numbers)
    and associated text content from a PDF.

    This is your refined Round 1A solution.

    Args:
        pdf_path (str): Path to the PDF file.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing 'title' and 'outline'.
              Each outline entry should also include the 'content_text'
              for that section/subsection.
              Example:
              {
                  "title": "Document Title",
                  "outline": [
                      {"level": "H1", "text": "Section 1", "page": 1, "content_text": "Content of section 1..."},
                      {"level": "H2", "text": "Subsection 1.1", "page": 1, "content_text": "Content of subsection 1.1..."},
                      ...
